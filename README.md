# Jupyter notebooks for machine translation technology teaching
This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks developed as teaching aids for machine translation teaching in the [MA in Specialised Translation](https://www.th-koeln.de/en/academics/specialized-translation-masters-program_7498.php) programme at the Institute of Translation and Multilingual Communication at TH KÃ¶ln, Germany. The notebooks are provided as open-source resources under the MIT License and can be used by interested parties for their own translation technology classes.  

The notebooks are provided in three forms:

**1)** As downloadable .jpynb files in this GitHub repository. The notebooks can be run on top of a local Python environment or uploaded to cloud-based environments such as Kaggle or Colaboratory.  

**2)** As Colab notebooks (links see below) which can be run directly in Colab provided the user has a Google account.  

**3)** In a separate Binder environment (again, links see below), where they can also be run directly online.
