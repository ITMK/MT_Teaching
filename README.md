# Jupyter notebooks for machine translation technology teaching
This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks developed as teaching aids for machine translation teaching in the [MA in Specialised Translation](https://www.th-koeln.de/en/academics/specialized-translation-masters-program_7498.php) programme at the Institute of Translation and Multilingual Communication at TH KÃ¶ln, Germany. The notebooks are provided as open-source resources under the MIT License and can be used by interested parties for their own translation technology classes.  

The notebooks are provided in three forms:

**1)** As downloadable .jpynb files in this GitHub repository. The notebooks can be run on top of a local Python environment or uploaded to cloud-based environments such as Kaggle or Colaboratory.  

**2)** As Colab notebooks (links see below) which can be run directly in Colab provided the user has a Google account.  

**3)** In a separate Binder environment (again, links see below), where they can also be run directly online.  

More information on how to run Jupyer notebooks in different environments and how to employ them in teaching scenarios can be found in [Barba et al. (2019): Teaching and Learning with Jyputer](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/). This book is an excellent resource which provides a wealth of information for lecturers interested in using Jupyter notebooks as didactic instruments in their classes.  

Initially, four notebooks are provided in this repository, two notebooks concerned with calculating string-based and word embedding-based MT quality scores and two notebooks for exploring word embeddings in the context of neural machine translation. In the future, further notebooks will be added to the repository.
