        "The word embeddings explored in this notebook are what you could call *normal* or *standard* word embeddings. These standard word embeddings are context-independent, meaning that each word is represented by just one vector, regardless of how many senses this word actually has and at which sentence positions it actually occurs. For example, in a sentence such as 'He left his **cell** phone in the prison **cell**', the word *cell* has two clearly distinct meanings, but standard word embedding approaches such as word2vec would collapse these different meanings into one single word vector. Contextual word embeddings are an upgraded version of these standard word embeddings, and these upgraded embeddings can be calculated by large neural language models such as Google's [BERT](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1423/). BERT generates different embeddings for a word depending on its context, i.e., depending on the sense in which it is used and where in the sentence it occurs. In the example sentence above, BERT would create two different embeddings for the two senses of *cell*. Therefore, contextual word embeddings are more powerful representations than standard word embeddings but at the same time, creating such contextual embeddings is computationally more expensive. More information on the difference between standard and contextual word embeddings can be found [here](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-main-differences-between-the-word-embeddings-of-ELMo-BERT-Word2vec-and-GloVe). Contextual word embeddings will be covered in a future notebook. "
